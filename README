This is the start of the latest implementation of nyclisp.  It is intended to compile to asm, working only on *nix/x86.
It is heavily inspired by aziz ghuloum's incremental approach to compiler generation, and by scheme-compiler from github.

notes to self:
generate as much as possible of the c driver program
steal the test suite from scheme-compiler ( git://github.com/ynadji/scheme-compiler )
