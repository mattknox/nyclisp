Need to be able to interop with native js libraries, possibly even inline bits of js.

possibly just like parenscript, where there's a sane syntax atop js, with something more interesting written in that.

coffeescript seems like a hard one to beat.  Need to think about that.


In ruby, one can write:
user.is_attractive? && user.is_single?  # or possibly
user.is_both? :attractive, :single      # or ideally
user.is_attractive?.and.is_single?
that last one requires is_attractive? to return the user, which is sorta odd.
user.andandtap.is_attractive?.andandtap.is_single?

it would be pretty trivial to write either a function or a macro like so:
(all? 'attractive 'single user) # function
(all? attractive single user) # macro

amusing pun: make # the reader character, and make it a comment if followed by a space.  Probably too cute by half.

interesting challenge:  how would one solve marcel's "build an extensible AR replacement" or @nk's modularity olympics question in nyclisp?
